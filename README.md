# Research-Project
With Universal Testing Machine (UTM), A load from 3 to 300N force is applied on Force resistive sensor.
Load data and raw sensor output (Resistance) is collected at same time. 
Nearly 12000 samples are collected from 3 sensors, data has been collected.
Data filteration like duplicate, repition, negative and unwanted data has been removed.
Sensor show expotenially decreasing for increase load, from 300N force sensor is saturated.
